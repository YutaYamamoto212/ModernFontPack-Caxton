# Modern Font Pack - Caxton Edition  
This is Modern Font Pack - Caxton Edition, which provides better font smoothing than [Modern Font Pack - Standard Edition](https://github.com/YutaYamamoto212/ModernFontPack). Fonts are taken from the [Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans) font family commissioned by Google.  

# Five major versions, JP, KR, CN, TW, and HK  
- **JP**: CJK font is **Noto Sans Japanese**.  
- **KR**: CJK font is **Noto Sans Korean**.  
- **CN**: CJK font is **Noto Sans Simplified Chinese**.  
- **TW**: CJK font is **Noto Sans Traditional Chinese**.  
- **HK**: CJK font is **Noto Sans Hong Kong**.  

# Known limitations  
1. When loading a resource pack for the **first time**, it may take a few minutes because Caxton mod needs to cache the resource pack's font files.  
2. Many characters do not have *italic* variants, which causes those characters that appear in *italic text* to always be displayed in regular variants.  
3. Similar to the previous point, some characters do not have a **bold** variant, which causes those characters that appear in **bold text** to always be displayed in regular variants.  
4. Doing any of the following while this resource pack is loaded may **crash the JVM**, thus causing **all resource pack be deactivated**:  
  - Changing the mipmap level.  
  - Changing the language.  
  - Activating or deactivating resource packs, or changing the order in which resource packs are sorted.  
  - Reloading resource packs.
